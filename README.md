Restaurant Roulette
===================

Restaurant Roulette is easy, simply spin the pizza to determine where you should grab lunch.

You can also add your favorite new lunch spot to the database, by clicking the green (+) button on the home page.

## Getting Started

To get up and running, you just need to clone the git repository, install dependencies, and kick off the development server.

All of the api calls are mocked out with miragejs, so things should just work™️.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:functionss/restaurant-roulette.git
cd restaurant-roulette

npm install
npm run dev
```
